 * The shop.

 * Everything paid lives on Patreon — there is no checkout here and no payment
 * code in this repo. The site's job is the storefront: what each product is,
 * what it costs, and one link that leaves for the seller. So the whole catalog
 * is one committed file, `static/data/shop.json`, edited by hand; nothing
 * derives a price and nothing fetches Patreon at runtime (their shop is
 * JS-rendered and its CDN URLs expire).
 *
 * A product with `price.amount` of 0 has no price set yet and is rendered as
 * "See price on Patreon" rather than "$0" — a free-looking paid product is
 * worse than no number at all.
